                <h3 class="section-heading">Goal and Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    The goal is to help students learn sheet music and improve their singing
                    ability. This will be accomplished by developing an application to provide choir
                    students with real-time, interactive feedback as they practice by analyzing
                    pitch, duration, dynamic, tempo, rhythm, and phrasing compared to the sheet
                    music provided by a choir instructor. The app will provide static and dynamic
                    exercises developed based on the sheet music. The app will also provide an
                    integrated communication tool between student peers and between students and
                    teachers to facilitate a conductive learning environment. We focus first on
                    choir students. Choir members are often expected to learn and practice on their
                    own, but many members either don’t practice, don’t know how to practice, or
                    don’t practice correctly. The impact of these circumstances is felt when the
                    choir practices; time is wasted reviewing and teaching students their parts
                    instead of working on integrating the choir together and focusing on the minutia
                    of the piece. Students tend to struggle when practicing independently for
                    reasons such as lack of training, discipline or self-confidence. Current
                    applications exist which can analyze music and provide feedback for students by
                    showing the discrepancy between what the student is performing and the
                    performance that was expected in regards to pitch and duration. The applications
                    that provide this feedback rely on a set series of exercises and abstract away
                    the actual sheet music and multi-part harmony. They also do not provide
                    interactive guidance to students who are struggling.

                <h3 class="section-heading">Novel Features and Functionalities</h3>
                <p>
                    The main novel feature of this approach lies in the real-time, interactive
                    feedback that assists students as they practice. Current systems provide
                    feedback such as showing you the visual discrepancy between the pitch and
                    duration that you are singing versus what is expected and expect you to fix your
                    singing yourself. Our approach will gather statistics across multiple musical
                    areas including pitch, duration, dynamic, tempo, rhythm, and phrasing. Using
                    these statistics, the app will formulate exercises to guide the student to
                    perfect the areas in the score where they are struggling. For example, if the
                    student is struggling with a certain few bars in the music then the app will
                    formulate an exercise with just the rhythm and will get the student to perfect
                    that rhythm before then focusing on the pitch and then putting them together.
                    These interactive sessions will help students who lack training to improve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other novel feature will be the communication tools between the student and
                    the teacher. Our app will provide the teacher with overall statistics over all
                    the practice sessions and will help the teacher to guide group practice by
                    highlighting areas where the group is struggling in the piece. Some choirs have
                    a choir director who is trained to guide practice and already do this in
                    practice. This feature would help choirs whose choir director is inexperienced
                    or in choirs like our acapella group on campus which is student led and lacks a
                    dedicated choir director.
